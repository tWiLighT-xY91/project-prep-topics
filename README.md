# 🧠 AI/ML Project Playground:

Welcome to my **AI/ML Journey Hub**, where I build mini-projects while learning cutting-edge tools & concepts like **Librosa**, **HuggingFace Transformers**, **AutoML**, **Docker**, **MLflow**, and more — all in preparation for FAANG-level mastery.

This repo is my **digital war room**, where each folder holds a skill I've learned, a model I trained, and a crown I claimed. 👑

## 🔥 What's Inside?

| 📁 Folder | 🛠️ Topic | 📌 Description |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| `librosa-audio-emotion` | 🎙️ Audio Processing | Feature extraction using MFCCs + emotion classification from voice using Librosa |
| `huggingface-text-sentiment` | 📖 NLP / Transformers | Text classification using BERT from HuggingFace 🤗 |
| `ensemble-learning-demo` | 🔗 Model Fusion | Combining multiple models for better performance (Voting, Stacking, etc.) |
| `automl-pycaret` | ⚙️ AutoML | Automatic model training and comparison using PyCaret |
| `docker-fastapi-api` | 🐳 API + Docker | Containerized ML model served through FastAPI |
| `mlflow-tracking` | 📈 ML Lifecycle | MLflow for experiment tracking, logging, and model versioning |
| `streamlit-dashboard` | 📊 UI/UX | Interactive dashboard to visualize predictions and metrics |
